Notes:

Application uses Swiz.  Folder/classpath structures are laid out in a classic approach.

Libs used:
so far Degrafa, PV3D, and Flexlib are in use.  Also Tink's libs are used for the PositionedTabNavigator
container that was required.  Also in use are Alex Harui's Distortion Effects which currently are the best
to use for the cube motions.  In a future release it will be good to target Flash Player 10 and 
the new 3D apis and thus relieve the reliance on the Distortion Effects and PV3D lib.
